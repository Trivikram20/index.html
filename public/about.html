<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Trivikram, and I'm a passionate learner who enjoys creativity and technology. To develop creative, meaningful solutions, I'm learning to become a full stack developer, ethical hacker, and video editor now. I develop smooth, user-friendly web applications through full stack development, from strong back-ends to interactive front-ends. I am driven by my experience with ethical hacking, which has enabled me to identify vulnerabilities in secure digital environments. I produce compelling visual stories by marrying technical precision and creative imagination in video editing. I love challenges and continually discover new methods and styles. My goal is to make projects that mingle creativity, security, and technology. I study technological advancements and develop my problem-solving skills apart from coding and editing. Let's build something amazingÂ together!</p>
